# Mapping_Earthquakes

Mapping Earthquakes using JavaScript

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

### Map Themes and Layers

For our project we decided to allow the user to toggle through several map themes and data layers.

![Dark](https://github.com/rulma/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/main/DARk.PNG)
![Out](https://github.com/rulma/Mapping_Earthquakes/blob/main/SAT.PNG)

As an example you can we have three possible map themes, Light mode, Dark mdoe, and Satellite themed overlays. 


In addition we also have three data layers that the user can cycle through.
